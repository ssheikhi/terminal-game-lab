### How to Play
1. You start the game using your **teeth** to cut grass and earn **$1** per day.
2. As you earn money, you can buy better tools:
   - **Rusty Scissors**: Cost $5, and you can earn $5 per day.
   - **Old-Timey Push Lawnmower**: Cost $25, and you can earn $50 per day.
   - **Fancy Battery-Powered Lawnmower**: Cost $250, and you can earn $100 per day.
   - **Team of Starving Students**: Cost $500, and you can earn $250 per day.
3. The goal is to reach **$1000** while using the **Team of Starving Students** to win the game.

### Game Logic
- The game runs in a loop, allowing you to either cut grass or check if you can buy better tools.
- Each tool increases your daily earnings, and once you have enough money, you can upgrade to the next available tool.
- The game ends when you have a team and $1000.

### Commands
- `cut`: Use your current tool to cut grass and earn money.
- `check`: Check your current balance and see if you can buy a new tool.
